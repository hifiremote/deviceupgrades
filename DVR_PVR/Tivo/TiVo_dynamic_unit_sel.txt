SA/DTiVo Protocols for Dynamic Unit Selection
=============================================

April 24, 2005 by Hal Takahara


With these custom upgrade protocols, you can reuse a single TiVo
device upgrade for multiple units of the same type by dynamically
switching unit code (aka remote address) instead of having similar
copies of device upgrade for every unit.


An unused register of the remote control's processor is used to keep
track of the current unit code, then you create key moves with the
Advanced Select special protocol to change value of the register.

I chose the register RBF in the examples below.  This is unused in
most of the s3c8/s3c8+ based remotes with or without the extender, but
any unused  register can be used instead of RBF if there's a conflict.


There are two versions of the protocols, one for Sony standalone /
DirecTiVo and another for all non-Sony TiVo.  You will need these two
protocol upgrades and three device upgrades (Sony SA, Sony DTiVo and
non-Sony TiVo) minimum if you want to control all the possible
models and unit code combinations.


Device/Protocol Upgrade Setup
-----------------------------

1. Use your existing TiVo device upgrade or get one from the Device
   Codes folder in the Files section.  The device upgrades for all
   Sony SA/DTiVo, 1-byte TiVo (Official) and TiVo (Advanced) should
   work.  2-byte TiVo upgrades will NOT work.

2. Load it into KM. (RM may be used if Manual Settings is fully
   supported already.)

3. Specify the values as follows on the Setup tab:

  Protocol Name: Manual Settings
  Device1: (blank)
  Device2: (blank)
  Device3: (blank)
  Raw Fixed Data:
    Sony:     5A 10 BF
    Non-Sony: 5E F3 BF

    (The 3rd byte is the register number for switching the unit code.
     Change it accordingly if you chose other register.)

  PID: (anything that does not conflict)
  2nd Cmd Byte: None

  (Sony)
  Signal Style: LSB
  Bits/Dev: 8
  Bits/Cmd: 7

  (Non-Sony)
  Signal Style: LSB-COMP
  Bits/Dev: 8
  Bits/Cmd: 8


  Notes / 3rd-Party Protocol Code:

  (Sony)
Upgrade protocol 0 = 01 DE (S3C8+) Sony SA/DTiVo Unit Sel
 3A 8A 31 8B 14 F6 15 08 07 02 58 01 18 01 2C 01
 18 57 D0 04 B0 01 18 05 03 25 05 04 7B 07 E6 03
 ED EB 02 00 28 8D 01 46
End

  (Non-Sony)
Upgrade protocol 0 = 00 41 (S3C8+) TiVo (Advanced) Unit Sel
 43 8D 31 8B 12 CF 44 08 08 01 1A 01 06 01 1A 03 
 31 D7 42 11 A7 08 B7 E5 05 C0 E4 06 05 60 06 46 
 06 F0 54 C0 06 F6 01 46 46 29 0D 8D 01 49
End

4. Modify other settings such as Remote type, button assignments,
   etc. as needed.

5. Copy and paste the Device/Protocol upgrades into IR.exe.


Creating Unit Code Selection Key Moves
--------------------------------------

6. Install the Advance Select special protocol shown below.  This is
   the same as the one in the special protocols spreadsheet, so you
   don't have to modify or install it again if you have already
   installed it.

   (You can change the Setup Code from TV/1105 to something else to
   match other special protocols.)

Upgrade code 0 = 1C 51 (TV/1105) Advanced Select (Special)
 FA 00 01
End

Upgrade protocol 0 = 01 FA (S3C8+) Advanced Select (Special)
 00 00 02 F5 04 03 AF
End


7. Create the key moves.

  Bound Key: (use Device/Key of your choice)
  Device Type/Setup Code: TV/1105
  Hex Cmd: $BF $XX

   $XX: value for the unit code of your choice

   Sony:
     SA1:$48, SA2:$E8, SA3:$68
     DT1:$10, DT2:$08, DT3:$00

   Non-Sony:
     0:$FF, 1:$7F, 2:$BF, 3:$3F, 4:$DF,
     5:$5F, 6:$9F, 7:$1F, 8:$EF, 9:$6F


Other Notes
-----------

 - Initial state of the current unit code is not guaranteed to be any
   specific value.  Make sure to execute one of the unit code
   selection key moves after resetting the remote.
