Notes=This records all codes transmitted by the InfraRed remote control for a "Silent Gliss Autoglide" curtain track (2005 vintage).\n\nThe protocol is "Kaseikyo-3.32", and the "Device Code" is always 0, also "E" is always 0.  But what is weird is that the "Sub Device" code is different for each button.  As there is only one sub-device setting per upgrade in RM or KM, it's therefore necessary to work around this problem as follows\:\n\n1. Make three or more separate upgrades with different (suggest consecutive) Setup Codes, one for each button you require to replicate.  In each upgrade assign the code to the button it will end up on.\n\n2. With IR install these upgrades to your remote, but don't assign them to any device button.\n\n3. In IR using "Key Moves" to manually assign the buttons from these "hidden" Setup Codes to the buttons where you want them (probably spare buttons in the set for another device).\n\nI tend to put them on the "transport" buttons for any device where transport is irrelevant e.g. SAT.\n\nAndy Merrick - June 2005\n
