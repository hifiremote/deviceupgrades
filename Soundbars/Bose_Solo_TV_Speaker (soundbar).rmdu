Description=Bose Solo TV Speaker (soundbar)
Remote.name=URC-2025
Remote.signature=254601
Notes=This upgrade maps the Bose soundbar functions to "in-obvious" remote buttons.  The text describing the Bose soundbar functions is also setup in a manner to help prevent accidental mapping of the functions to more obvious remote buttons.  The reason for this is that the Bose soundbar can be setup on an "Audio" or "AMP" device key on the target remote and the "Volume punchthrough" for the audio device can be left to target the "TV".  In this way, the normal volume control and mute buttons can be used to control the TV speakers whilest the Bose can be used to add rich BASS by using the the up/down buttons while in audio mode.  You can get a real nice sound by doing this - far better than using the Bose soundbar by itself.
